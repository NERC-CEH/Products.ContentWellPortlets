Products.ContentWellPortlets Installation
==========================

To install Products.ContentWellPortlets into your Plone site, you have various optoins

(Either)
= Install as an old style Zope 2 Product =
Because its top level Python namespace package is called ``Products``, this
package can be installed in Zope 2 as an old style **Zope 2 Product**.
(a) Check the product out of subversion onto somewhere on your file system
(b) move (or symlink) the ``ContentWellPortlets`` folder 
(``Products.ContentWellPortlets/Products/ContentWellPortlets``) into the ``Products`` directory of
the Zope instance it has to be installed for, and restart the server.
(c) You should see ContentWellPortlets available in the portal_quickinstaller and Add/Remove Products pane
of the Plone Control Panel

(Or)
= Using buildout =
If you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe, you can do this:

(i) Add ``Products.ContentWellPortlets`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.:
 
    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        ...
        Products.ContentWellPortlets
        
(ii) Stop Zope and re-run buildout, e.g. with:
  
    $ ./bin/buildout -N

(iii) Restart Zope; you should see ContentWellPortlets available in the portal_quickinstaller and Add/Remove Products pane
of the Plone Control Panel


(Or)
 * If you are using Zope 2.9 (not 2.10), get `pythonproducts`_ (http://plone.org/products/pythonproducts)
   and install it via:: **

       python setup.py install --home /path/to/instance

   into your Zope instance.

 * Create a file called ``Products.ContentWellPortlets-configure.zcml`` in the
   ``/path/to/instance/etc/package-includes`` directory.  The file
   should only contain this::

       <include package="Products.ContentWellPortlets" />
